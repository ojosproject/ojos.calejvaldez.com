# Ojos Project Docs

![Ojos Project header](@site/static/images/header.png)

The Ojos Project Docs' goal is to provide you with as much information of the
project as possible in a simple and easy to understand way. Although the project
is relatively young, our documentation is rapidly growing on a near-daily basis.

## Getting Started

There's a lot of different things you can explore. For example...

| Doc                                                                                                          | Description                                                                     |

| [Iris Documentation](/docs/iris/)                                                                            | Iris is an open-source hospice management system developed by the Ojos Project. |
| [Palliaview Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l60y9Kog3sbdiTm0TlWQSpLGMTpvvO05bGnn72r-dA8/) | Palliaview is our plug-and-play solution for Iris software.                     |
| [Website Documentation](/docs/website/)                                                                      | `ojosproject.org` has a lot of neat features that are documented.               |

## Need help?

These docs should be simple to understand and constantly updated. If that is not
the case, please contact either
[engineering@ojosproject.org](mailto:engineering@ojosproject.org) for the
Engineering Docs or
[contact@ojosproject.org](mailto:contact@ojosproject.org) for everything
else in the docs.

Otherwise, you may raise an issue in our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/ojosproject/website/issues/new?assignees=calejvaldez&labels=documentation&template=docs.yml&title=âš %EF%B8%8F+Insert+a+short+title+for+your+issue.).

Thanks!
