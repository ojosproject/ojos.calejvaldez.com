Some individuals in the Ojos Project are participating for UCI credit under the
course IN4MATX 199. When Carlos first started the Ojos Project in October, he
was required to enroll in the course to ensure he sticks to the
[Undergraduate Research Lab](https://markbaldw.in/url) and takes it seriously.

## Benefits of enrolling in 199

Individuals enrolled in IN4MATX 199 get a 2-5 unit course grade.

## Benefits of not enrolling in 199

Individuals not enrolled in IN4MATX 199 are allowed freedom to move in and
out of the project as they please. Individuals enrolled in 199 have to stick
with the project for a minimum two-quarter commitment.

## Can I join 199?

It depends. If our Undergraduate Research Lab advisor is willing to allow more
students, it's possible. However, please ask the URL Committee directly to see
if it's possible for you to be enrolled.
