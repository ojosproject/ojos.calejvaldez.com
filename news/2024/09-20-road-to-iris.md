# Road to Learning Rust, NextJS, and Tauri

![Ojos Project header](@site/static/images/header.png)

Iris has been in development in the entire summer. It's been a slow but steady
pace seeing as how Iris comes with new experiences for the developers. With any
new experience, however, there are challenges.

In this more technical news post, learn about how the team managed to get around
working with the Rust programming language, NextJS, and Tauri!

## Background

[Iris](https://github.com/ojosproject/iris/) is the Ojos Project's open-source
hospice management system. It's a program we've been researching for since
October 2023 and building since May 2024. Our goals for the project is to ensure
we have a centralized storage for hospice management that can be relayed to
other caregivers of a hospice patient. Some of the planned features we include
to have are:

- Medication management
- Video recording
- Noting care instructions
- ... and more.

The program is being build with various tools, notably
[React/NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) and
[Tauri](https://tauri.app/). We're also using [git](https://git-scm.com/) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/).

The challenge for us is to learn how to use these tools to the best of our
abilities, as many of us haven't worked with them. We are a team of amazing
programmers from the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/) that
decided to take on the challenge of using these tools effectively to build Iris.

## Front end with NextJS

Hi! My name is Mai Luong, and I’ve been working with Ojos since last Spring. My
responsibilities have primarily focused on developing the medication with
NextJS. I’m currently a 4 majoring in Informatics and Political Science
at UCI, and I’m excited to continue growing my skills in software development
through this project!

This summer, I've been learning server-side rendering and building Ojos UI.
Next.js simplifies many tasks like routing and API handling, which makes it
a powerful tool for frontend development. Routing become intuitive by allowing
me to create pages through the file system. Each pages corresponds
to a route in the application, streamline the static routing process.

One of the key challenges I've been working through is learning about connecting
frontend with backend. Learning how to present the necessary data from
back-end data have proven to be an informative learning experience.
