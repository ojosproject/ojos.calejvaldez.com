# Fall 2024 Wrap Up

Another quarter in, another quarter out. Let’s talk about what we’ve been doing
in the Ojos Project!

## Developer Updates

### Software Coming Together

Developers have been hard at work making Iris come together. Although we're not
quite yet to confirm it as a beta just yet, we have screenshots!

![Iris Resources](@site/static/images/iris_resources.png)

![Iris Medications](@site/static/images/iris_medications.png)

Iris now has medication logging, leaving instructions for caregivers, and
resources. As time goes on, Iris will mature and become more reliable as time
goes by.

We aim to have an official beta by March 2025.

## Engineering Updates

### Palliaview V0.2 Development

Engineers started by redesigning the monitor shell. The purpose of redesigning
the outer shell was to create a case that would better fit onto the monitor.

Further protecting and concealing the electronics connected to the rear of the
monitor. After redesigning the shell, it was 3D printed and marked for further
improvements.

The arm mount was also redesigned this past Fall quarter to create a more stable
mount that would support the monitor. It was then 3D printed and inspected for
further development.

## Research Updates

Mai Luong conducted interviews to obtain information and insight on the current
care caregivers give and patients receive. Mai also created a poster to create
more outreach opportunities for the research team.

During the fall quarter, the research team made significant progress in several
key areas. Outreach efforts included engaging potential participants through
social media, emails, and expanding outreach across campus. These efforts
resulted in expressed interest from three potential participants, leading
to the successful completion of one interview with a healthcare professional
and one scheduled interview before the end of the year. The interview conducted
provide valuable discussion to our project.

Looking ahead to the winter quarter, the team plans to build on this momentum by
increasing the frequency of campus outreach, continuing our efforts on social
media to engage a broader audience, and conducting additional interviews.

## General Updates

### CHI 2025 Research Competition

Big news on the publication front for the Ojos Team. If you haven't seen our post
for this [Summer's news](/news/summer-2024-wrap/), the Ojos Project will be
attempting to enter the [Computer-Human Interaction](https://chi2025.acm.org/)(CHI)
conference's Student Research Competition hosted by the Association of COmputer
Machinery  (ACM).

In short, this mean the Ojos Project team will be *fingers crossed* being going
to Yokohama, Japan to present our finding and solution to the problem of Hospice;
and furthermore, Palliative management space for caregivers. It will be taking
place from April 26th - May 6th, 2025.

The team was formed for the competition by Engineering Team Leader Joseph Sweatt.
Documentation  preparing for the CHI 2025 Research Competition began this quarter.

The CHI Competition:

>conference embraces the theme of Ikigai, a Japanese concept referring to what gives a person a sense of purpose, a reason for living. Today’s world, people are facing a multitude of challenges in climate change, growing inequality, technological disruption, global conflict, and health crises. Ikigai concerns the ability of a person to find their purpose and balance their agency, their passion, their capabilities, and the impact they can have. The CHI community consists of people with many passions and talents, people from different disciplines and walks of life. In harnessing our ‘Ikigai’ into a communal ‘IkiCHI’ we can be greater than the sum of our efforts and offer unique contributions to solving the difficult challenges ahead.

It is an opportunity for our team to show the contributions and work we had made
already and get more insight from our peers, supporters, and even potential users
of our systems. We hope you continue with our journey into the winter quarter
and as we pursue this competition. Thank you all!
