Another quarter in, another quarter out. Let’s talk about what we’ve been doing
in the Ojos Project!

## Developer Updates

### Software Coming Together

Developers have been hard at work making Iris come together. Although we're not
quite yet to confirm it as a beta just yet, we have screenshots!

![Iris Medications](@site/static/images/iris_medications.png)

Iris now has medication logging, leaving instructions for caregivers, and
resources. As time goes on, Iris will mature and become more reliable as time
goes by.

We aim to have an official beta by March 2025.

## Engineering Updates

### Palliaview V0.2 Development

Engineers started by redesigning the monitor shell. The purpose of redesigning the outer shell was to create a case that would better fit onto the monitor and protect and conceal the electronics connected to the rear of the monitor. After redesigning the shell, it was 3D printed and marked for further improvements.

The arm mount was also redesigned this past Fall quarter to create a more stable mount that would support the monitor. It was then 3D printed and inspected for further development.

## Research Updates

Mai Luong conducted interviews to obtain information and insight on the current
care caregivers give and patients receive. Mai also created a poster to create
more outreach opportunities for the research team.

During the fall quarter, the research team made significant progress in several
key areas. Outreach efforts included engaging potential participants through
social media, emails, and expanding outreach across campus. These efforts
resulted in expressed interest from three potential participants, leading
to the successful completion of one interview with a healthcare professional
and one scheduled interview before the end of the year. The interview conducted
provide valuable discussion to our project.

Looking ahead to the winter quarter, the team plans to build on this momentum by
increasing the frequency of campus outreach, continuing our efforts on social
media to engage a broader audience, and conducting additional interviews.

## General Updates

### CHI 2025 Research Competition

A team was formed for the competition by Engineering Team Leader Joseph Sweatt. Documentation in preparation for the CHI 2025 Research Competition was started. The CHI Competition is
