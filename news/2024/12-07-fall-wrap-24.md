## Developer Updates

### Software Coming Together

Developers have been hard at work making Iris come together, and although we’re
not yet ready to confirm it as a beta just yet, we have screenshots!

Developers researched the integration for connecting wearables and external devices to Iris. They also researched Twilio to build phone number relaying.

Engineers started by redesigning the monitor shell. The purpose of redesigning the outer shell was to create a case that would better fit onto the monitor and protect and conceal the electronics connected to the rear of the monitor. After redesigning the shell, it was 3D printed and marked for further improvements.

The arm mount was also redesigned this past Fall quarter to create a more stable mount that would support the monitor. It was then 3D printed and inspected for further development.
