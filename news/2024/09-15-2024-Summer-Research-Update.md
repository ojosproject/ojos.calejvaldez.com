## What Happened?

Throughout this summer our members went through many achievements and
accomplishments. To begin, our members

## Iris Development

The developers finally began the very messy process of programming. We decided
to take up the challenge and learn various tools that we're not too familiar
with, such as the Rust programming language and NextJS. As well as learning
these tools, we also adapted a collaborative workflow with GitHub and started
using [pull requests](https://github.com/ojosproject/iris/pulls/) to better keep
track of our process on specific features.

As of now, there isn't too much to show, [as we're still actively working on
Iris](https://github.com/ojosproject/iris/commits/main/?since=2024-06-13&until=2024-09-15).
As soon as we have more to show, we will immediately display it here.

Until then, the developers are working on a more technical news post to show
what we've been doing during the summer, which will be released soon. Stay
tuned!
