accomplishments. To begin, our members

## Developer News

### Rust, Our Beloved

Developers in the Ojos Project spent a good chunk of the summer exploring the
[Rust programming language](https://rust-lang.org). ðŸ¦€

Rust is an efficient and memory-safe programming language started in 2007,
though officially released by Mozilla in 2015. The
language has recently been [mentioned in a White House report](https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/03/04/in-rust-we-trust-white-house-office-urges-memory-safety/)
after mentioning the need for memory-safe programming languages in cyberspace.
The US military's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is starting
a program to translate their existing C code to Rust, called the [TRACTOR
program](https://www.darpa.mil/program/translating-all-c-to-rust).

Although the University of California, Irvine does not provide a Rust class as
of now, we believe that working with Rust is a skill that will be beneficial
for our members.

### Iris Development

[Developers have been hard at work](https://github.com/ojosproject/iris/commits/main/?since=2024-06-13&until=2024-09-15)
with developing Iris. Iris is being built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app), a
modern toolkit for building desktop applications alongside
[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/).

Although it's been a slow process, Iris is starting to come together nicely.
