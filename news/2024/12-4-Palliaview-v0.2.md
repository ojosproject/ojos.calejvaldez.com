# Palliaview V0.2 Update

![Ojos Project header](@site/static/images/header.png)

The Engineering team has developed the Palliaview system into the next stage.
We have 3D printed the [new shell](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LkSjbK6iT8F5QuMHFIHtM4qL38IK150e?usp=drive_link)
and mount for the system, making it customizablev and adaptable for any surface and purpose.

The Palliaview v0.1 shell was unable to securely and evenly hold the display
monitor. With the new shell design, it fully encompasses the body of the
monitor, making the system more structurally sound.

We reduced the material used by 44% going from 323g of PLA filament used in the
display shell to 183g for this iteration.

Thus, Reduce manufacturing time from approximately 8 hours to 5.5 hours of 3d printing
time for display.

## Development of Palliaview V0.3

We are excited to announce the new development stage of V0.3. In this new
iteration, we are bringing a new design to the internal system with the
implementation of embedded systems replacing the Raspberry Pi.

We can reduce the cost of production and increase power efficiency by doing this.
On the outer aspect of the Palliaview, we are continuing to develop the shell
to be slimmer and material efficient,and making the mount more user-friendly.
