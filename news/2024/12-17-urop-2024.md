# Ojos Project wins (another!) UROP grant

![Ojos Project header](@site/static/images/news-header-01.webp)

In November 2024, Ojos Project submitted a proposal to the UCI Undergraduate
Research Opportunities Program, also known as UROP. We applied for the Research
Experience Fellowship, the same one we had applied for last year. Ojos Project
is proud to announce that, for a second year in a row, we've won another UROP
Research Experience Fellowship grant!

With this funding, Ojos Project is able to continue our research to further
improve the hospice space. Keep an eye out!

## Undergraduate Research Symposium

As tradition, this also means that Ojos Project will be participating in the UCI
Undergraduate Research Symposium. We're excited to see you again! Mark your
calendars for May 12-15, 2025!

## Acknowledgements

Thank you once again to everybody involved in the Ojos Project. Particularly,
thank you to the team who've been working tirelessly to help bring Iris and
Palliaview into existence. As you know, without your help, this wouldn't have
been possible.

And with this, we close out 2024. Have a great rest of the year everybody!

:^)
