## Our Outreach Methods

we are combining various approaches to foster meaningful dialogue. Our
personalized outreach allows us to connect one-on-one with individuals, enabling
closer examination of your expertise and feedback. At the same time, we also
conduct campus-wide initiatives through poster distribution across campus along
with classroom discussions help us introduce Iris to a broader audience while
sparking vibrant community conversations. These efforts are complemented by
individual interviews designed to provide a personal and welcoming space where
participants can share their stories, challenges, and ideas freely.
